# FAMILY FRIENDLY

### BACKGROUND

In 2021, how is it that rest stops don't provide changing tables in the mens room (or often at all?!). My family will specifically seek out Starbucks while on road trips, as we can be assured they will all at least provide changing tables accessible by caregivers regardless of gender, snacks, a standard of cleanliness, and of course coffee for us sleep deprived adults.

My wife suggested building an app that would allow an overstressed parent to quickly look and see whether a rest stop option included those basic childcare amenities, and thus Family Friendly was born!
