# FAMILY FRIENDLY

### BACKGROUND

Any male caregiver is far too familiar with the drama of diaper changing on-the-go. My family will seek out Starbucks while on road trips, if only because we can be assured they will provide: changing tables accessible by caregivers regardless of gender, assorted snacks, a standard of cleanliness, and of course coffee for us sleep deprived adults.

My wife suggested building an app that would allow an overstressed parent to quickly look and see whether a rest stop option included those basic childcare amenities, and thus Family Friendly was born! As a simple MVP (minimum viable product), the app currently plots _a map showing spots that feature a changing table, and what type of restroom it's in (Womens Only, Both, etc)._ Users can view this data based on their geolocation, and if they choose to securely log in with their Google account, they can add their own places and report when they encounter (or don't) the unicorn that is changing tables in both bathrooms.

### SCREENSHOTS

### GETTING STARTED

Site should load in any modern browser but was developed using Chrome. The layout is designed primarily for mobile, since parents will be using the app on the go. User must enable geolocation when asked to view their location on the map.
