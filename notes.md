Also, important is the fact that MongoDB requires coordinates to be ordered in [Long, Lat] format. (Backwards-seeming. I know. But very important.) This is especially important to remember because Google Maps requires coordinates in the other direction [Lat, Long]. Just try to keep things straight as you're working.

##### USER STORIES

- A non-logged in user can only view a list of places, and those places' report cards
- A non-logged in user can search by location to narrow the list
- A user can log in and log out
- A user can add a place if it doesn't exist
- A user can add a report card for an existing place
- A user can delete their own report card
- A REPORT CARD can contain an optional Y/N to PLACE fields: POTTY? - TABLE M? - TABLE W? FRESH? NUM-NUMS? COFFEE? MASKS?
